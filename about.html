                <p>Decentralized domains bring many benefits, but unfortunately they are not widely supported. This is where One Address comes in, One Address was made to provide the crypto community with a clean and ad-free way to access decentralized domains.</p>
                    
                <p>One Address resolves decentralized domains, and presents users with all associated addresses, links, and NFTs.</p>
